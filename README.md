### Project for [DSC Solution Challenge 2021](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge "DSC Solution Challange 2021")
##### BY TEAM CODING POLTERGEISTS
Messmate is an end to end solution for mess management. It acts as a link between hostelers and mess staff, helps in efficient management of the mess and decrease food wastage due to overproduction.


### Features:
**1. Prior information about absentees:**

Hostelers can send prior notification to the mess if they plan to skip a meal on that day. The expected number of absentees is shown on the staff dashboard which helps them prepare the food accordingly, hence reducing wastage due to overproduction.
   
**2. Meal rating and reviews:**

Rating (out of 5â˜…) and textual reviews/suggestions can be sent by the hostelers after the meal, which can help the staff gather feedback about the food easily, and maintain the food quality.
   
**3. Announcements via push notifications:**

Mess staff can make important announcements directly from the mess dashboard, which are immediately delivered to all the hostelers registered in that mess as push notifications.
   
**4. Check daily menu:**

Mess can post weekly menu which is visible to all the hostelers registered in that mess.
